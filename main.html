<p> Blood cannot be manufactured in factories; it can only come from generous donors. To cater to this demand, BloodConnect was launched on 1st April, 2010 (as
 a project under NSS IIT Delhi) with an unparalleled o
 bjective of solving the problem of blood shortage in India.<img src="main1.jpg" align="left" hspace="70" vspace="30" >According to WHO data, India faces a shortage of 3 million blood units. This shortage can easily be eliminated if only an additional 2% of India's youth donates blood. To make this possible, BloodConnect acts as a channel connecting voluntary blood donors with those who need blood. It is a youth-run organization and provides free help and specially works to target the poor and the needy.

Since its inception, <br>the organization has grown a lot in terms of working for this cause. BloodConnect has developed a 360 degree solution 
to the problem
 of blood shortage. The model revolves around 4 focal points:</p>
